# Overview

The purpose of this project is to learn java using the IntelliJ IDE

This program allows the user to record, display, remove, save, and load tasks for a single day.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
